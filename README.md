Dude, just got done 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Accountant 2, and wow, I have thoughts. You ever just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a  , expecting it to be okayish, and then it’s like, “Nah, we’re going full-on wild ride today”? That’s basically what happened! Like, Ben Affleck... as an accountant, again. But somehow, it's even more intense. I swear, it's like if Jason Bourne suddenly decided to balance your checkbook. 😂

I mean, the action scenes were mad. Like, seriously, why does an accountant need so many weapons? Does he write off bullets on his taxes or what? Haha! And I swear, there’s a car chase at some point, and I was soooo into it, can you even imagine me getting this hyped over a   about numbers? 🙄

> Also, can we talk about how they somehow make doing math look cool? Well, cooler than it is anyway. I tried to balance my own budget last week, nearly put me to sleep. But Ben? He’s like solving crime and dodging bullets with Excel spreadsheets or some sht. I don’t know, it’s just wild, ya know?

And the plot twist, oh my gosh, do you ever just sit there and think, “Wait, did I zone out for a second, and now we’re completely somewhere else?” That's basically what happened, but in a good way. I kinda wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to figure out how the heck we got from point A to point… wherever we ended up!

Anyway, speaking of wild rides, I had this flight yesterday where some guy got super upset over peanuts, like lost it. But seriously, next time someone asks me why I'm tired, I’m just gonna tell them I tried 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this crazy   while pretending to understand math and doing flights where peanuts cause riots.

int main() { return 0; }

Man, I don’t even know why I wrote that, haha. But okay, hit me up when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , we gotta compare notes on who was more confused, you or me! 😉
